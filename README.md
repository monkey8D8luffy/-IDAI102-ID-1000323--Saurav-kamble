# 🍃 ShopImpact - Ultimate Streamlit Edition

**ShopImpact** is a gamified personal finance tool that tracks the **environmental cost** of shopping. It estimates carbon footprint, water usage, and tree loss for every purchase, encouraging sustainable habits through real-time visual feedback and badges.

##  Key Features

* **Gamification:** Unlocks badges (e.g., "👑 Thrift King", "🛡️ Eco Warrior") for hitting sustainability milestones.
* **Visual Feedback:** Triggers **Green Leaf** animations for eco-friendly choices and **Dry Leaf** drops for high-carbon items.
* **Eco-Nudging:** Suggests sustainable alternatives (e.g., "Try Refurbished") before a purchase is logged.
* **Analytics:** Interactive charts showing Spending vs. CO₂ trends, category breakdowns, and "Eco vs. Regular" comparisons.
